Object : Issue & complaint - Defective Material - Regie Woods 


Respected Sir/Madam,

I write you here in the name of Mrs Woods who's experiencing various issues with your services.

I took the liberty to check Mrs Woods various devices to adress you this initial inquiry and noted that, to begin with, the internet speed is not
conform the one advised in her subscription plan. After tests on various websites, upload and download speed is not even the tenth of what it should be.

Secondly, the firewall of her router isn't active, this is a huge security issue that should be fixed as quickly as possible.

To finish, it seems that the Power line adaptor connected to the TV is defective.

By the present, I require replacement of the defective material and that a technician is booked to come here, at Mrs Regie Woods place,
to review and fix the various part of her setup that isn't up to the norm.

if you fail to comply, Mrs Woods will reserve the right to terminate her contract and request a refund of all services purchased to FancyCables ltd.

i'm looking forward to hearing from you, as soon as possible.

Best regards,

Guillaume Saulnier
