Dear english-only speaker of our great company,

I got the charge to send you this note regarding the new rules in applications regarding the covid event. 
So for starters, please be sure to follow the schedule by the book, do not come if you're not working that day,
and do not take a break, even if you're close to bursting your bladder, unless prompted on the planning. I know you're
aware of this already, but I must remind you that wearing your mask is a must, and no, i'm not talking about your epic Hannibal Lecter mask,
the correct one must cover your airflow so you can properly overheat in this sweet summertime. 
Once done with your work, event that must be, as you know now, precisely timed, please clean your desk and laptop with the wipers and gel at your disposal. 
Please don't use your personnal hair gel, it will not have the desired effect. Adding to all of this, keep the window opens at all time, even if it rain, 
freeze or swarm in case of locusts season. State regulations enforce 5mn per hour but us, Management, think this way is better. Finally, if you show signs 
of sickness, please demonstrate your best french person impersonation and run at the closest HR building so you can stop working and start complaining.

Wish you the best remote work,

regards (over your shoulder, all the time)

Dear collaborators,

As you already know, the pandemic is far from over. As such, the company has decided to implement a set of rules to be followed rigorously.
A planning has been sent earlier and I ask you to respect it to avoid crowding the workspace. Please keep yoir face mask on at all times
and avoid getting close to your colleagues by leaving 1 meter between the work stations. Furthermore, clean your material after each use with 
the provided wipers and alcoholic gel. A 5mn ventilation per hour is highly recommanded to renew the air in the premises. In t he event of symptoms, 
please stay at home and take a test. If it is positive, send an email to HR and be isolated for 7 days. Your efforts will be appreciated and i wish
that we all stay safe.
Please ask if you have any questions
X
Kind regards.

Main idea is about working habits of remote work and how to maintain them on the long run.
- Don't focus on showing that you're working but work just as you would normally
- Following the previous idea, responding to mail or messages instantly isn't mandatory for all of them
- Take breaks, exercises, walk outside, breath some hair. Studies show that not only all of this is important for 
	physical and mental health, but also that it help productivity, helping you to solve issue that you were unable 
	to solve when focused on it.
- Rethink your habits to make them work on the long run
- Remind yourself that everyone is on the same boat, so you're not the only one stuck with your kids yelling in the background.
