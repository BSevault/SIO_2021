Cloud Computing

Definition: 
	The expression “cloud computing” comes from English IT professionals.
	Cloud computing is the use of a network with remote servers hosted on the Internet to store, manage and process data. 
	It’s a new way to provide computer technology solutions as a form of a service. In fact, all the resources are available 
	as a public service on Internet. 
	So, we talk about « Infrastructure as a Service » (IaaS).
	We have mainly 2 levels of analyzing the cloud technology. 
	1st one is the access of distant servers mainly as a storage device in order to prevent loss of data and for backup purposes. 
	Example of services delivered by companies such as Dropbox/ onedrive etc ... 
	2nd application is that consequent internet speed has brought a new way of using cloud computing. Users can access resources 
	remotely and use computing power of distant servers. This means that the user only needs to connect to the service via an interface which 
	can be a tablet/ laptop/smartphone etc. It does not matter how powerful is the interface as all the processing is done by the distant server. 
	A simple example would be online applications such as " google docs ". 

Advantages:
    • Lower production costs (electricity, maintenance, security, investment in hardware…)
    • Optimize hardware utilization (to use available resource when only needed) Scalability. scalable / " sur mesure "  -   
    • Security. Cloud providers have experience in monitoring networks and data access. They invest hugely to respect the specifications of 
		their customers. 
      
Disadvantage:
    • Your infrastructure is totally dependent of the network reliability and your internet service provider. 
    • You also allow a third party to access to your data. The cloud service provider, by default will have access to the data they host.
