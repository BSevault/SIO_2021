Mise en Situation : 
You have been asked to explain the possibilities of Internet Of things and object connectivity in the notion of a smart home. 

Questionnement : 

1 - Who are the people that benefit from this technology ? 

The idea behind Internet Of Things is to ease your life through network connected gadget in every way you can, and probably can't even, imagine.
It can benefit anyone who's willing to accept to trade a fair amount of privacy for comfort and security. Yes your provider will know exactly when you 
binge eat a whole pizza and how much  toilet paper you use a day, but at the same time you'll never run out of milk in the morning and your home will 
always feel warm and cozy without much extra cost. Some system can guard you against robbers,  let you check on your child while at work or even
see when your mate is cheating on you ! There is many extra features that can benefit frankly anyone, even your family dog will be able to order his favorites 
treats without even having to beg you for it.


2- Are there any kind of security issues for the users ? 

Security wise, well, your data will be known (even if our company will pretend otherwise) by a few entities, like china, usa, and even most of europe, but that's
not something you should concern yourself with. We'll use your private informations only to give you the best recommendations of products based on your profile, you
should be glad we're spending so much effort getting to know you frankly. In a way, we're connecting people, you can be sure that nowoday people need connection,
especially with covid rules ! That's it, that's our catchphrase ! Connecting people, against their will for their own good ! 
Buy our Dubious Internet Connect Kamera System, DICKS for shorts, you'll feel the difference.
