I've browsed a bit to find some kind of social media management tool ranking website, and after a bit of research, it seems that
the application Buffer might be a fit. This app is either free (but a bit limited) or will roughly cost our company around $10 to $15 a year.
With this, you will be able to gather all of our social media account into one single app, manage your performances in a few clicks and
plan your campaigns ahead of time. With the premium plan, you'll get access to various data analytics on your audience as a bonus, among various 
other perks. This tool cover the biggies of social media: Instagram, facebook, linkedin, twitter and even the soon to be dead pinterest.
I think this is a decent choice to get used to those kind of tools for a cheap price, and eventually invest into a more complex one later on.
This app will allow us to reduce drastically the time invested into managing our social image and also the amount of workers dedicated to it.
For the price of a pizza, this is a way to centralize this whole deal.
